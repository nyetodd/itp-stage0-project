    <h1>Web basics</h1>
    <h3>Some background on how the web works</h3>
    <p>
      The world wide web is made up of HTML documents. HTML stands for <em>Hyper Text Markup Language</em>. These are documents are linked together though the use of hyperlinks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h4>Major pieces of the web</h4>

      <b><em>Browser:</em></b> The browser is the tool that a person uses to makes requests via the internet to servers. Web content is viewed on a browser (such as Chrome, Firefox etc) <br>
      <b><em>The internet:</em></b> A massive global computer network that allows data and documents to be retrieved and viewed by using standard protocols such as <em>HTTP</em><br>
      <b><em>Servers:</em></b> Servers store files and content. When they receive requests they identify what is being requested and pass this back.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example:
      If you enter the url for the video streaming site <a href="http://www.youtube.com">YouTube</a> into your browser,
      this request is passed using the HTTP protocol to servers which then return the HTML page for that website which is rendered by your browser for you to see.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML and Markup</h3>

    <p>HTML is made up of the following elements: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Text content: <em>what</em> is written on the page </li>
      <li>Markup: tags that decide <em>how</em> this content is displayed</li>
      <li>References to other documents</li>
      <li>Links to other pages</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>A bit more on markup</b><br>
      Markup is made up of tags. An opening tag will be placed at the start of the text or item
      that we want to change the look of, and the closing tag at the end. The only difference is that the closing tag has a forward slash '/'
      The tags and what is within them can be referred to as the 'element'. If you forget to add a closing tag when applying a style to text (eg. making it <b>bold</b> with the 'b' tag)
      then the style will be applied to all text on the page.
